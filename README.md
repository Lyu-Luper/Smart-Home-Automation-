The system features a Java Swingâ€“based graphical user interface (GUI) designed for simplicity and ease of use. Users can:
1. View real-time sensor data such as temperature, humidity, and light levels.
2. Monitor the current state of devices (e.g., fan ON/OFF, lights ON/OFF).
3. Set or adjust threshold values for automation rules.
4. Enable or disable specific rules with a single click.
5. Receive error or status messages when inputs are invalid or sensors fail.
The interface updates automatically based on incoming data and provides a responsive, interactive experience even for users with no technical background.
